# Impact-of-environmental-factors-on-Bike-Rentals

In this project, we are exploring the Capital Bike sharing dataset, made available to us by the UC Irvine Machine learning repository (Hadi Fanaee-T, n.d.). We start by taking a look at the dataset, the variables involved and then clean the dataset for model building. The Capital bikeshare system collected the historical data logs in Washington DC over a period of two years, i.e. 2012 & 2012. With our analysis in this paper, we plan to determine the correlation of environmental factors like the weather conditions, season, time of the day, day of the week, etc. with the bike rental behavior of the public and then use the results from this analysis to come up with a strategy to promote the usage of bike sharing in both the casual and registered users, whilst also aim at converting the casual users into registered ones.
